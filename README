This is some crap for taking output from weather stations that report via HTTP
and feeding home assistant data into a remote IRC bot...

* HTTP
	Protocol: AmbientWeather (eventually or WeatherUnderground)
	Host: Your server IP
	Port: 9990
	Path: /report/?data=y
	- This *must* be as such, to work around invalid GET query parameters from wx station (first arg with & instead of ?)



-----------
You can tell an instance on one host to upload to another using forwarders.

You can also configure the IRC bot to connect to a remote ambientwx-proxy.

See config.example.yml



# All:
	Copy config.example.yml to ~/ambientwx.yml or ./config.yml then edit it

# httpd.pl:
	./httpd.pl &

# sensors.pl:
	sqlite3 turdbot.db < sensors.sql
	./sensors.pl --list | less
# Or similar - find entities you want and add to sensors.sql and rebuild the db as above
	./sensors.pl &

# bot.pl:
	cp example.irc.sql ircbot.sql
	sqlite3 turdbot.db < ircbot.sql
	./bot.pl


If all works OK with manual startup, you can startup automatically with ./startup.sh

Hope it's useful!
