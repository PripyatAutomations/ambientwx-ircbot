This is some crap for taking output from weather stations that report via HTTP

* HTTP
	Protocol: AmbientWeather (eventually or WeatherUnderground)
	Host: Your server IP
	Port: 9990
	Path: /report/?data=y
	- This *must* be as such, to work around invalid GET query parameters from wx station (first arg with & instead of ?)



-----------
You can tell an instance on one host to upload to another using forwarders.

You can also configure the IRC bot to connect to a remote ambientwx-proxy.

See config.example.yml
