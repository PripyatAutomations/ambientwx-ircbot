- Add support for !page with restrictions on when/who can use it stored in db
* Add a counter from connect to first AUTH message, to reconnect on stuck servers (about 20-30 sec is plenty)

* Implement a way to have the httpd send to a remote irc-bot instead of the file
  in case one wants to keep them separated
	- PUSH and PULL versions of this
		- irc-bot listens for HTTP POSTs 
		- irc-bot polls httpd via GET
